### Architectural Principles

This system is built on proven architectural principles:

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dependencies pointing inward
2. **SOLID Principles**: Maintainable, extensible, and testable code
3. **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models aligned with business logic
4. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Core business logic isolated from infrastructure
5. **Event-Driven**: Loosely coupled components communicating via events

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Review the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) document to understand the system design
- Review the [DOMAIN_MODELS.md](DOMAIN_MODELS.md) to understand data structures
- Check [IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) for development phases

### Technology Stack (Recommended)
- **Backend**: Laravel 10/11 (PHP 8.1+) with modular architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache)
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka
- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, or Angular
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Cloud**: AWS, Azure, GCP, or self-hosted
- **Packages**: 
  - nWidart/laravel-modules (modular structure)
  - stancl/tenancy (multi-tenancy)
  - spatie/laravel-permission (authorization)
  - Laravel Multi-Lang (translations)
