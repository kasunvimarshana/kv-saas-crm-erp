## Architecture

The module follows Clean Architecture and SOLID principles:

### Entities (Domain Models)
- `Supplier` - Supplier information and ratings
- `PurchaseRequisition` - Purchase requests
- `PurchaseRequisitionLine` - Requisition line items
- `PurchaseOrder` - Purchase orders
- `PurchaseOrderLine` - PO line items
- `GoodsReceipt` - Received goods records

### Repositories
Each entity has an interface and implementation following the Repository pattern:
- `SupplierRepository`
- `PurchaseRequisitionRepository`
- `PurchaseRequisitionLineRepository`
- `PurchaseOrderRepository`
- `PurchaseOrderLineRepository`
- `GoodsReceiptRepository`

### Services (Business Logic)
- `SupplierService` - Supplier management and rating
- `PurchaseRequisitionService` - Requisition workflow and approval
- `PurchaseOrderService` - PO generation and management
- `GoodsReceiptService` - Receipt processing and 3-way matching

### Events
- `RequisitionApproved` - Fired when a requisition is approved
- `PurchaseOrderCreated` - Fired when a PO is created/sent
- `GoodsReceived` - Fired when goods are received and confirmed
- `SupplierRated` - Fired when a supplier rating is updated

## Usage Examples

### Create a Supplier
```php
$supplier = SupplierService::create([
    'name' => 'Acme Corp',
    'email' => 'sales@acme.com',
    'phone' => '+1-555-0100',
    'payment_terms' => 'Net 30',
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'status' => 'active',
]);
```

### Create a Purchase Requisition with Lines
```php
$requisition = PurchaseRequisitionService::createWithLines([
    'requester_id' => 1,
    'department' => 'IT',
    'requested_date' => now(),
    'currency' => 'USD',
], [
    [
        'product_id' => 100,
        'quantity' => 10,
        'estimated_unit_price' => 99.99,
    ],
]);
```

### Approve a Requisition
```php
$requisition = PurchaseRequisitionService::approve($requisitionId, $approverId);
```

### Create PO from Requisition
```php
$purchaseOrder = PurchaseOrderService::createFromRequisition($requisitionId, [
    'expected_delivery_date' => now()->addDays(30),
    'payment_terms' => 'Net 30',
]);
```

### Receive Goods
```php
$receipt = GoodsReceiptService::createFromPurchaseOrder($purchaseOrderId, [
    $lineId1 => 10, // Received quantity for line 1
    $lineId2 => 5,  // Received quantity for line 2
], [
    'received_by' => 1,
    'warehouse_id' => 1,
]);
```

### Perform 3-Way Matching
```php
$matched = GoodsReceiptService::performThreeWayMatch($receiptId);
```

## Integration

### With Inventory Module
- Product references in requisition and order lines
- Updates inventory on goods receipt confirmation

### With Accounting Module
- Generates accounts payable on confirmed purchase orders
- Tracks payment status
- Records supplier invoices for 3-way matching

### With Warehouse Module
- Receives goods into specific warehouses
- Updates stock levels on confirmation

## Testing

Run module tests:
```bash
php artisan test --filter Procurement
```

Seed test data:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class="Modules\Procurement\Database\Seeders\ProcurementSeeder"
```

## Security

- All endpoints protected with `auth:sanctum` and `tenant` middleware
- Tenant isolation enforced in all queries
- Authorization checks in controllers (TODO: Implement policies)
- Input validation via Form Requests
- SQL injection prevention via Eloquent ORM

## Performance Considerations

- Indexes on all foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- Eager loading for relationships to prevent N+1 queries
- Database transactions for multi-table operations
- Soft deletes for data retention

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Email notifications for requisition approvals
- [ ] PDF generation for purchase orders
- [ ] Supplier portal for PO acknowledgment
- [ ] Advanced approval workflows (multi-level)
- [ ] Budget checking for requisitions
- [ ] Contract management for suppliers
- [ ] RFQ (Request for Quotation) functionality
- [ ] Automated PO generation based on reorder points
- [ ] Supplier catalog integration
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
