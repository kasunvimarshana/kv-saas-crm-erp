## Usage Examples

### Create an Invoice

```php
POST /api/accounting/v1/invoices
{
  "customer_id": 1,
  "invoice_date": "2024-02-09",
  "due_date": "2024-03-09",
  "currency": "USD",
  "lines": [
    {
      "account_id": 4100,
      "description": "Consulting Services",
      "quantity": 10,
      "unit_price": 150.00,
      "tax_rate": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

### Record a Payment

```php
POST /api/accounting/v1/payments
{
  "customer_id": 1,
  "invoice_id": 123,
  "payment_date": "2024-02-09",
  "amount": 1650.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": "bank_transfer",
  "reference": "TXN-12345"
}
```

### Create a Journal Entry

```php
POST /api/accounting/v1/journal-entries
{
  "entry_date": "2024-02-09",
  "description": "Rent payment for February",
  "currency": "USD",
  "lines": [
    {
      "account_id": 5220,
      "description": "Rent Expense",
      "debit_amount": 2000.00,
      "credit_amount": 0
    },
    {
      "account_id": 1110,
      "description": "Cash",
      "debit_amount": 0,
      "credit_amount": 2000.00
    }
  ]
}
```

## Business Logic

### Double-Entry Validation
All journal entries must be balanced (total debits = total credits). The system automatically validates this before posting.

### Automatic Journal Entries
The system automatically creates journal entries when:
- An invoice is sent (DR: Accounts Receivable, CR: Revenue)
- A payment is received (DR: Cash/Bank, CR: Accounts Receivable)

### Fiscal Period Controls
- Journal entries can only be posted to open fiscal periods
- Closed periods prevent new entries
- Locked periods cannot be reopened

### Invoice Aging
The system automatically tracks invoice aging in buckets:
- Current (not yet due)
- 1-30 days overdue
- 31-60 days overdue
- 61-90 days overdue
- Over 90 days overdue

## Database Schema

### Key Tables
- `accounts` - Chart of accounts
- `journal_entries` - Journal entry headers
- `journal_entry_lines` - Journal entry lines (debits/credits)
- `invoices` - Customer invoices
- `invoice_lines` - Invoice line items
- `payments` - Payment records
- `fiscal_periods` - Accounting periods

All tables include:
- Multi-tenant isolation (`tenant_id`)
- UUID support
- Soft deletes
- Audit timestamps
- Proper indexes for performance

## Events

- `InvoiceCreated` - Fired when an invoice is created
- `PaymentReceived` - Fired when a payment is processed
- `JournalEntryPosted` - Fired when an entry is posted
- `FiscalPeriodClosed` - Fired when a period is closed

## Testing

Run module tests:
```bash
php artisan test --testsuite=Accounting
```

## Integration
